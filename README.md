# TeaMí

[Live Demo](https://tea-mi.herokuapp.com)

TeaMí was inspired by Facebook Messenger, which is a real-time messenger. TeaMí is able to deliver instant messaging through technologies like Rails and ActionCable, PostgreSQL, React.js, Redux, and AWS S3 storage along with paperclip. This project was given a timeframe of 10 days. Knowing this, features are limited, but I plan on expanding and making the application better overall.


## Features
  * User Authentication, backend and frontend, utilizaing BCrypt
  * Creating Chats with any other user that has an account
  * Messages or sent in real-time, thanks to Rails' ActionCable, a helper for websockets
  * Sending Gifs thanks to the Giphy API
  * Adding more members to a chat
  * Changing your profile picture, chat picture, or chat name


### Messages and Chat

When creating a new user account, the default new chat page is shown. Users can be searched through the search bar of the chat.
